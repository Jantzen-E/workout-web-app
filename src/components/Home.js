                <span className="questions">WHAT IS THIS WEBSITE?:</span> This website is a compilation of exercises that I have learned over the years from people who are a lot
                smarter than I am.  I have learned these from well-known workout programs, fitness gurus/body builders on social media,
                and from trying lots of different exercises out to find which ones I feel like work better for me personally.

                <span className="questions">WHO IS THIS SITE FOR?:</span> This is for anyone who wants to improve their life by doing exercise.  Exercise helps you feel better
                by releasing chemicals in your brain that can improve your mood.  It can help improve depression, winter blues, and feelings of laziness and lack of energy.
                This site is for people who want to see which exercise works which muscle so that they can improve their physique which can boost self esteem.

                <span className="questions">WHY USE THIS SITE?:</span>  Use this site if you want to know which exercise works out certain muscles/muscle groups.  I broke it down in 
                a simple way so that you can find exercises that focus primarily on specific muscle groups so that you can tailor your workouts to your needs.  For example,
                if you feel like your upper body is in better shape than your legs, you can put a greater focus on the glutes, hamstrings, quads, calves etc. to build those
                muscles so that you are satisfied with your overall look and so you are well balanced with your fitness goals.

            <p>
                <span className="questions">WHICH EXERCISES SHOULD I DO?:</span>  This all depends on what your goals are.  In my opinion, I would put a stronger focus on the
                areas where you would like to improve with a lesser focus on the other areas.  I would still recommend working out each muscle group but just change the focus
                based on your personal goals.

                <span className="questions">WHERE CAN I DO THESE EXERCISES?:</span>  Many of these exercises can be done from home with minimal equipment.  If you have 
                exercise bands or dumbbells then you can do most of these.  Other equipment that is used are things that are common household items like chairs, couches,
                doors, etc.  If you find an exercise that requires gym equipment that you don't have access to, there are alternative exercises that will most likely work so 
                you can do your research if you don't find all the alternatives in this site.
